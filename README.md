# LA's Creative Pulse: Comparing Local and National Trends

<h1>Story Pitch:</h1>
<p>In the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles, a vibrant tapestry of creative industries weaves together a story of innovation, expression, and cultural significance. The pulse of this dynamic ecosystem is driven by artists, creators, and visionaries who contribute to the city's unique artistic identity. In this data journalism project, I delve into the heart of LA's creative landscape, armed with carefully curated datasets sourced from the Los Angeles Arts Datathon and powered by the insights of Economic Modeling Specialist International's proprietary model. This investigation takes us deep into the employment dynamics of LA's creative industries, dissecting the numbers to uncover patterns, trends, and untold stories. Beyond the data points, this project explores the important issue of diversity and inclusivity within LA's creative sectors.</p>
