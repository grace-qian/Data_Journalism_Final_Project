<h1>Story Pitch:</h1>
<p>In the sprawling metropolis of Los Angeles, a vibrant tapestry of creative industries weaves together a story of innovation, expression, and cultural significance. The pulse of this dynamic ecosystem is driven by artists, creators, and visionaries who contribute to the city's unique artistic identity. In this data journalism project, I delve into the heart of LA's creative landscape, armed with carefully curated datasets sourced from the Los Angeles Arts Datathon and powered by the insights of Economic Modeling Specialist International's proprietary model. This investigation takes us deep into the employment dynamics of LA's creative industries, dissecting the numbers to uncover patterns, trends, and untold stories. Beyond the data points, this project explores the important issue of diversity and inclusivity within LA's creative sectors.</p>

<h1>Data Analyses:</h1>
<p>My data is souced from CVSuite, a product of the Western States Arts Federation (WESTAF). I have 5 questions that I will investigate and answer using data analysis techniques in Google Sheets. </p>
<p>
<h4>1. Which creative occupation had the largest male to female ratio and which creative occupation had the largest female to male ratio? </h4>
<h4>2. How do the earnings in LA County's creative fields fare against the broader US trends?</h4>
<h4>3. Which age bracket in the US has the most creative workers? What is the top creative occupation for this age group?</h4>
<h4>4. Which creative occupation has the highest hourly salary and what is it's growth from 2014 to 2015?</h4>
<h4>5. What were the top occupations for each age bracket? What was the overall top occupation for each age bracket?</h4>
