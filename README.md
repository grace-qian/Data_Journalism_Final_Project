<h1>Story Pitch:</h1>
<p>Creativity knows no boundaries, and in the bustling metropolis of Los Angeles County, a diverse tapestry of creative occupations weaves together to form a vibrant economy. For my final journalism project, I aim to delve into the realm of creative occupations in LA County, utilizing robust datasets sourced from the "Finding Datasets" repository under "Arts and Culture." Are certain creative fields more appealing to specific age groups? How diverse and inclusive is the creative industry in LA County? How does LA County's creative economy compare to national trends? Beyond the data points, this investigation takes us deep into the employment dynamics of LA's creative industries, dissecting the numbers to uncover patterns, trends, and untold stories.</p>

<h1>Data Analyses:</h1>
<p>My data is souced from CVSuite, a product of the Western States Arts Federation (WESTAF) and I will be using two datasets from the Los Angeles Arts Datathon. I have 5 questions that I will investigate and answer using data analysis techniques in Google Sheets. </p>
<p>
<h4>1. Which creative occupations that have the most gender diversity? Which have the least gender diversity? </h4>
<h4>2. How do the earnings in LA County's creative fields fare against the broader US trends?</h4>
<h4>3. Which creative occupation had the largest growth from 2014 to 2015 in LA and in ths US? And which had the biggest decline?</h4>
<h4>4. Which creative occupation has the highest hourly salary in LA and in ths US and which had the lowest?</h4>
<h4>5. What are the top occupations for each age bracket?</h4>
</p>

<h2>Data Analysis 1</h2>
<h4>Which creative occupation had the largest male to female ratio and which creative occupation had the largest female to male ratio? </h4>
<p>For this first question, I made a pivot table with two calculated fields - one column was for the male to female ratio and another was for the female to male ratio. The pivot table is in the screenshot below.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis 2</h2>
<h4>How do the earnings in LA County's creative fields fare against the broader US trends?</h4>
<p>I currently have two datasets - one for LA county (Occupation_TableLA county.xls) and  and one for the US (Occupation_TableUS.xls). Both of these spreadsheets have a tab called Occupations_Jobs_Earnings that shows the hourly wages for each occupation. To compare LA hourly wages to National hourly wages, I created a pivot table. The values are the hourly wages and the rows are the different creative occupations. The pivot table is in the screenshot below.</p>
<h2>Data Analysis 3</h2>
<h4>Which age bracket in the US has the most creative workers? What is the top creative occupation for this age group?</h4>
<h2>Data Analysis 4</h2>
<h4>Which creative occupation has the highest hourly salary and what is it's growth from 2014 to 2015?</h4>
<p></p>
<h2>Data Analysis 5</h2>
<h4>What were the top occupations for each age bracket? What was the overall top occupation for each age bracket?</h4>
