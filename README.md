<h1>Story Pitch:</h1>
<p>Creativity knows no boundaries, and in the bustling metropolis of Los Angeles County, a diverse tapestry of creative occupations weaves together to form a vibrant economy.

Are certain creative fields more appealing to specific age groups? How diverse and inclusive is the creative industry in LA County? How does LA County's creative economy compare to national trends?

<h4>2. How do the earnings in LA County's creative fields fare against the broader US trends?</h4>
<h4>3. Which age bracket in the US has the most creative workers? What is the top creative occupation for this age group?</h4>
<h4>4. Which creative occupation has the highest hourly salary and what is it's growth from 2014 to 2015?</h4>
<h4>5. What were the top occupations for each age bracket? What was the overall top occupation for each age bracket?</h4>
